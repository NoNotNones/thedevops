#### Overview
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a cornerstone of DevOps methodology, emphasizing automation and collaboration throughout the software development lifecycle.

- Continuous Integration (CI):
  - Developers regularly push code changes to a shared repository.
  - Automated tests are run against the newly integrated code to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality.
  - If tests fail, developers are notified immediately, and they can address issues before they become larger problems. 
- Continuous Deployment (CD):
  - Once code changes pass the CI phase, they're automatically deployed to production or staging environments.
  - This process reduces manual intervention and ensures that new features or bug fixes reach users as quickly as possible.
